# Description
A data science project where I used statistical models and python to rank the most important statistics among NCAA championship qualifying basketball teams over the last decade. Visualizations can be viewed in the jupyter notebook. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25htrKC7lDE) for my analysis of the results.

## Problem Description
The ultimate goal of a division 1 college basketball program is to win the NCAA championships. Therefore, the problem a coach may face is how they can analyze the statistics of previous college basketball teams to figure out what statistics are important for this task.

For this project, I am using a logistic regression classifier to classify a team as either likely to qualify for the tournament or not. And comparing logistic regression to other classification models.

## Background
Each year the 68 best college basketball teams are selected to play in the tournament. The selection consists of the champions of the 32 d1 conferences as well as the 36 most highly regarded teams by the official NCAA selection committee. In total there are 351 div 1 teams across the country, so making the tournament is already an accomplishment for most teams. It’s worth noting that UB has appeared in the tournament only 4 times in the team’s history.

## Dataset Background
We are using a public [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset) from kaggle that contains statistics about every men’s d1 team from the 2013 to 2023 basketball seasons. This is 10 seasons total because the 2020 season was canceled. The following is the full list of the features of the dataset along with their abbreviation and meaning. There are 24 features in total.


## Run Instructions
Simply, run each cell of the Jupyter notebook.
